Welcome to heyDJ! Have you ever wanted to make a song request? If so, did your song ended up getting played? Time and time again, people have great song requests at social events that end up going unheard. heyDJ aims to solve this problem.

In this web based application, users can create events, indicating they are the DJ. Users can then find events and choose to either RSVP, or join. Within the event they can make song requests which their fellow peers can up and down vote on. The more upvotes, the more likely your song will get heard!
